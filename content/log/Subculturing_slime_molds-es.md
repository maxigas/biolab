Summary: Subculturing physarum polycephalum slime molds

## 2013-11-05 summary

Our first subculturing!  Since the Biolab is not ready yet we did it in the kitchen.  All biolabs should start in kitchens.  We had no scalpel and forceps so we used a Wilkinson Sword razor blade.  We had many other proper equipment missing so we used other improper equipment.

 * We received slime mold aka *Physarum polycephalum* about one week ago.  They are in two petri dishes.
 * They both grew sporangium and some fine white mycelium with small black spots – the latter is not on the Internet!
 * We opened one of petri dishes with the slime mold and subcultured it to 4 other dishes
 * We put them in the fridge, which is turned off at the moment so we guess it is around 20℃.
