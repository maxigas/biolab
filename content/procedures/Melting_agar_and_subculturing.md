Summary: Prodecure for melting agar and subculturing
Lang: en

*status*: **experimental**

## Melt Agar

Agars is a neutral medium to grow things in petri dishes.  It is normally like a gel, and it needs to be heated above 40℃ to melt.  When melted, it can be poured in petri dishes to prepare them for culturing.  The petri dish can be used when the agar geled (solidified).

Needs:

 * fire
 * water
 * geled agar in sealed bottle
 * pot a bit wider than bottle and higher than agar level

Procedure:

 1. Put pot on fire
 1. Put bottled agar in pot
 1. Put water in pot as high as agar level in bottle
 1. Note: It can help to shake the agar
 1. Wait for agar to melt

## Subculture slime molds

Subculturing is to devide the slime mold in the petri dish (e.g. a slime mold culture) to several petri dishes, so you can later do various things with them.  It is also good practice to subculture every week even if you don’t do anything special.  By dividing your stock you increase the chance of their survival.  All operation is done as near the fire as possible.  The fire sterilises the air.  For the same reason, try to move slowly so that you don’t disturb the air.  Sterilise as many things as best as you can, except your cultures.  Don’t sterilise cultures.

Needs:

 * fire
 * scalpel or blade
 * forceps or similar
 * empty petri dishes
 * petri dishes with slime mold
 * electric tape
 * aluminium foil
 * liquid agar
 * sterilised malt

Prodecure:

A. Prepare:

 1. Wash hands
 1. Start fire

A. Prepare petri dishes for culturing:

 1. Open empty petri dishes
 1. Pour liquid agar in petri dish (40ml)
 1. Put around 24 pieces of malt in petri dish
 1. Close petri dish
 1. Repeat with all empty petri dishes

B. Put slime mold to the prepared petri dishes:

 1. Open petri dish of slime molds
 1. Sterilise scalpel by holding in the fire for 6 seconds
 1. Cut slime mold culture to as many pieces as the empty dishes, plus one
 1. Open a prepared petri dish
 1. Use forceps to pick a piece of culture
 1. Put piece of culture to the prepared petri dish near the wall
 1. Close the filled petri dish
 1. Seal the filled petri dish with electric tape
 1. Wrap the filled petri dish in aluminium foil
 1. Optional: Poke a 0.5cm hole in the aluminium foil above the mold
 1. Repeat with all prepared petri dishes
 1. Close original petri dish

C. Storage

The little hole above is to incite the mold to move to the other side of the petri dish.  This cleanses it because if it is contaminated, the contamination will not move but stay put below the hole.  If you follow this prodecure you need to store the mold in a place with at least some light.  In any case for subculturing we use around 20℃ (“room temperature”).
