Summary: Project desription of slime mold farming and the development of the biological computer.

Since the last three months we have been keeping and subculturing slime molds in the Biolab.  We are working according to a roadmap with the eventual goal to develop a biological computer.  There is a “white paper”

# Current status

We have various problems:

 1. all our cultures are contaminated;
 2. we haven’t seen the slime molds move;
 3. they don’t really look like the pictures on the Internet. :)

We think that this is mainly due to the humidity and cold we had in the winter.  The temperature was around 7℃ and since there is a river flowing around and under our building, a lot of humidity.  We are addressing this by building an incubator which can maintain the proverbial [“room temperature”].

We had two iterations so far and working on a third:

 1. Plastic barell with water tank heated by aquarium heater.  *Total failure.*
 2. Fridge with water tank heated by aquarium heater.  We can maintain 14℃ in this contraption which is *not enough*.
 3. The third design is should be soon described here soon.
