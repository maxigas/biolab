Summary: Project description for the incubator.

We need an incubator for almost all our projects (slime molds, forest microbes and water quality measurement).  So this is the first piece of equipment that we try to build for the Biolab.  We discussed the designa and started to acquire the materials.

Paula Pin suggested this design:

[Design A](http://biodesign.cc/2013/12/25/diy-incubator/)

Biopablo suggested this design:

[Design B](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ9WLnCAd1M)

We will try to combine these two designs for something appropriate to our needs and the materials we have.
