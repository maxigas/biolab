Summary: Project description for measuring water quality.

The [Biolab] is located in [Calafou], an Eco-industrial Post-capitalist Colony.  [Calafou] is part of the [Cooperativa Integral Catalana] (CIC), an umbrella organisation for cooperatives which seeks to fulfill all human needs through collaborative production.  The role of [Calafou] in the CIC is mainly grassroots technology research and development and industrial production.

The CIC recently identified a need for measuring the water quality within its various projects.  Therefore, the Calafou Biolab is making a proposal to fulfill such need by developing the capacity for water quality measurements, which we could offer as a service to the CIC and beyond.  We have made the initial research and started to build the basic equipment, while we are waiting for the CIC to discuss our proposal.
